# PROJECT 2 RESOURCES

This GitHub repository serves as a resource for students during project 2 of the RNA Institute Bioinformatics Fellowship. Students can find information on the datasets available to them as well as tools for analysis and visualization here.

Our intention is to make this GitHub site available indefinitely as a resource for ongoing and future projects.
